# SMS-XML-Parser
I created this script to parse the results of a specific XML file format for better readability.

Using the [SMS Backup & Resore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore "Play Store Link") app, I exported my text messages to an XML file. However, the file was difficult to read so, I created this page to better display the results. 

This script was initially created for a one time use, but I thought it may come in handy again in the future. For that reason, I began adding features to make it easier for others to use, and I do plan to add additional features in the future as time permits.
